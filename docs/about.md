# About Lev Bible

Patent pending, but the Lev Bible app is free to use. For other applications of the underlying language-learning technology, [reach out to Levitable](mailto:levitable.org@gmail.com). 

The Lev Bible is for anyone who can read English, but wants a little more understanding. Starting as an English translation, it can reveal underlying Hebrew/Greek words.

The Lev Bible starts as an English translation (NASB), where English words are tappable to substitute the original-language word in-place. No prior understanding of either Hebrew or Greek is required (not even knowledge of their alphabets), because a transliteration of the original-language word in English letters is included.

For example, opening the Lev Bible the first time, a reader will see the book of Genesis. Tapping the word "God" in the first verse will "untranslate" this to the Hebrew word "elohim." As the reader continues, all instances of the word "elohim" will be untranslated.

This app provides Bible readers, who may have little or no knowledge of biblical Hebrew or Greek, an easy way to start learning, by immediately reading the Bible itself.

Readers with some familiarity with reading Hebrew and/or Greek may choose to optionally remove those transliterations.
