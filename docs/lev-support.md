# Known issues

| #   | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Small uppercase letters (e.g. in `the LORD`) not yet implemented.
| 2   | English words with no original equivalent, between untranslated words, should be removed. E.g. `Spirit of God` should be simply `ruakh elohim` with no `of`. 
| 3   | Dangling English words with no original equivalent, to the side of untranslated words, but attached to that untranslated word, should be removed. E.g. `the LORD` -> `yhwh` rather than `the yhwh`
| 4   | When opening the chapter menu, the user should first see the current book open, with the current chapter highlighted.
| 5   | Tapping the already-selected chapter from the chapter menu should close the chapter menu.
| 6   | When a group of contiguous English words is untranslated, and the original words are also contiguous in the original, but in a different order, they should be reordered to follow the original. E.g. in Gen 1:1 `bara elohim` rather than `elohim bara`.
